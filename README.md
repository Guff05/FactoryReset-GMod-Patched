# Garry's Mod Factory Reset Tool
This script resets Garry's Mod to its default state, clearing server files, cache, and settings.

## How to Use
1. Place `FactoryReset-GMod.bat` in your Garry's Mod folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod`).
2. Right-click the file and select "Run as administrator."
3. Follow the prompts to confirm the reset.

## Notes
- Ensure the executable name matches your setup (`gmod.exe` by default; edit the script if itâ€™s `hl2.exe` or another name).
- Back up any important data (e.g., dupes in `garrysmod\data`) before running.
